/* API code goes here. The webpages will be using JavaScript to build 
 * the interface after retrieving JSON from the server using this api.
 * 
 * Each possible data retrival and insertion operation will have its
 * own 'if' clause that will be triggered based upon the 'GET' variables
 * passed.
 * 
 * If no 'if' clause is triggered, the 'else' will be triggered which
 * will display info about how to use the api. The 'else' will also
 * check if invalid 'GET' variables have been set and will warn accordingly.
